Over on the O'Reilly Network, there's an interesting piece about how Microsoft tried to [hire people to contribute to Wikipedia](http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/01/an_interesting_offer.html). Not wanting to do the edits directly, they were looking for an intermediary to make edits and corrections favorable to them.

Shame on you Microsoft
