Now that I think of it, I've been using Mozilla Thunderbird for more than 3 years now, it is one of the best email clients I have ever seen, and with the available extensions, it can do almost anything.

At home, I only open Thunderbird when I want to check for new email, but at work, I like to leave it open all the time in case I get any emails from my coworkers.<!--more--> In Windows, Thunderbird has a nice little notification icon that appears in the system tray when a new message arrives, when I recently switched to Linux on my work PC, I started to get annoyed by the fact that this icon doesn't appear when new messages come, so I have to check my mailbox every few minutes.

I have tried multiple notification plugins, but never found anything interesting, till today. I stumbled upon [moztraybiff](http://moztraybiff.mozdev.org/), which does exactly that, and enables you to minimize Thunderbird to the system tray, which is neat.
