title: "Bettering Myself"

It's been a long time since I have added anything to my blog; I wanted to update my site to use the newer version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I also wanted to update the theme to remove some of the older componets and disable [Disqus](https://disqus.com). One of the things I wanted to do is to use [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) to learn how it works. I got halfway through the HTML and then real life got in the way. For some reason I kept delaying adding new content because I thought updating the theme to the newest Hugo version would take a long time.<!--more-->

A few days ago I ran across the YouTube channel of [Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/user/Sepharoth64) and what he says looks intriguing. [This particular video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acBJsjCqgtM) got me thinking that I should just start writing and worry about the other stuff later.

I decided to write my first post today even with the older Hugo version; It's a static site generator so no security risk there. But when I started writing this post I thought should bring the theme up to date if it's not going to take a lot of time, and it only took about 30 minutes.

Ali talks about [this book](https://www.amazon.ca/Show-Your-Work-Creativity-Discovered/dp/076117897X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=show+your+work&qid=1620406310&sr=8-1) which I have ordered. Will be going through it and trying to apply some of the ideas Ali talks about. Will I be a millionaire like him? Most probably not, but improving my soft skills has been on my TODO list for ages, might as well try.
