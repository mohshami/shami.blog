My dear friend Bandar offered me a great deal on his old Macbook Pro. I've been wanting to try out MacOS for ages and thought this would be the perfect chance for it.<!--more-->

After using the laptop for about a day now. I have to admit Leopard has very nice eye candy, but that's it I'm afraid. It's too mouse oriented, and I like to use the keyboard, a LOT. It seems I'm gonna stick with Linux for the time being, especially with Lucid Lynx being around the corner, but I'll give Leopard a few more days and see if it grows on me.

Have a good day everybody
