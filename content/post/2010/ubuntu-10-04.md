When Ubuntu 9.10 came out I was very eager to try it, but sadly I was very disappointed. So when I was downloading 10.04 I wasn't really expecting anything. I'm glad I was wrong.<!--more-->

So far it appears the sound and flash issues have been fixed. Empathy seems to have gotten some improvements. Most noticeable are the fact it now saves the window position of the contact list, and gives you an indication when the person you're chatting with on Google Talk is typing something on the keyboard.

If you hate the new window button placement, like I do, here's how to fix it:

1. Open gconf-editor
2. Got to /apps/metacity/general
3. Change "button_layout" to "menu:minimize,maximize,close"
