An hour ago I needed some sticky notes for a project I'm working on. Since it was past 9PM the nearby stationary shops were closed, so I had to go to one of the mega stores in Amman.

When I reached the cashier lines I was holding a pack of sticky notes, a roll of tape and a pen. Looking at the lines I saw one that had a sign above it that read "Express Line, 10 items or less". The other lines had people with lots of stuff in their carts so I thought I should go to the "Express" line to finish faster.

This is not the first time this happens. Apparently this store always makes the ***SLOWEST*** employee handle the Express line. He was so slow, so clumsy and so inconsiderate that the so called "Express" line was in fact slower than the other lines. This line should be labeled "The extra slow line, use it if you have time to waste!".

I guess those of you who go to that store will know which one I'm talking about.
