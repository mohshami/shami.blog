My current employer is switching from FirstClass to Microsoft Exchange. One of the questions I got from an employee was how to make Outlook print the first page of an email. When I went to the print dialog I was surprised that it doesn't have a page range selection option, which surprised me. Having used Windows since version 3.0 I found that option in all Windows applications.

Anyways, according to [Microsoft](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/924141), you can't. That's right, they removed one of the very basic options in email from their flagship email client.

The best alternative I found it is to preview in Internet Explorer and print from there.
