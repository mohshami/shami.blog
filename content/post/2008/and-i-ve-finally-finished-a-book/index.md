If you know me, you’d know that I’m not a big fan of reading.Last week a friend of mine lent me this book, which I only started reading because I was too bored on a weekend. Surprisingly I could not let go of it till I fell asleep. I finished 160 out of the 200 pages in the same day. I just finished reading it and I have to say it is a very fun read. Two thumbs up!
