I came across [this guide](http://www.myscienceisbetter.info/2008/09/install-google-chrome-on-linux-using-wine.html) about installing Google Chrome under Ubuntu. It is somewhat slow, slower than Windows and much slower than Firefox but it still works, well, kinda. You have a few problems with fonts, as well as sites that don't work properly with Chrome yet. I'm sticking with Firefox for the time being, but at least I have an option for those sites that aren't compatible with it.

I wrote this post from Chrome, so yeah, it does work :)
