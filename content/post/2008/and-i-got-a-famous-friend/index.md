So I log in to my Facebook account (Which is something I very rarely do) and I find a friend invitation from a very famous singer, [Ragheb Alama.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragheb_Alama)

I was very excited. So excited I ignored him faster than he could say: "Nasini Edonia". As if someone like him would wander around in Facebook to add friends :). Even if he was the actual Ragheb, Iâ€™m not even a fan :D

Have a great day everybody.
