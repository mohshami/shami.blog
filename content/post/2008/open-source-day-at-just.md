Yesterday I went to my old school; The Jordan University of Science and Technology ([JUST](http://www.just.edu.jo)) to attend the first Open Source Day. Hopefully it won't be the last.

The event was great, I met lots of great people. The students look so eager to learn. I wish them all the best. Good luck guys, can't wait to attend the event next year inshalla.
